### "_Emotion in Motion_"


[Active Online Link to Application](https://gcmillar.github.io/e-motion/).


This application uses cyclists' physiological data to see how emotions can be affected by our environment. To begin, use the 'Toggle Cyclists' menu on the left (as shown below) to start exploring their emotions along the bike routes. The cyclists highlighted in yellow are those currently being displayed on the map. And be sure to use Street View! With this, it is easier to understand what the cyclists may have been seeing while experiencing high levels of emotion.
